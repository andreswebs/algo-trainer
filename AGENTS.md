# Instructions

Use Serena MCP to read Serena memories before any task.

If the Serena MCP tools are not available, stop and ask the user to set it up.

Do NOT modify Serena memories, unless it is to record new learnings.

Ensure you always run, before and after each task:

```sh
deno task check
deno task lint
deno task test
```

If there are any errors, fix them before starting the task. After completing the task, check again and fix any errors before committing your changes.

Always ensure new functionality has corresponding tests.
