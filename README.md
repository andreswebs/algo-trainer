# algo-trainer

An offline LeetCode practice environment.

**Note**: This is an experiment in AI spec-driven development. Don't take it too seriously.

## The story

This is a work-in-progress. I started this repo to test the capabilities of Cursor with the `Opus 4.5` model and investigate orchestrating agents in parallel. This is essentially an experiment for `$WORK`, but may turn out to be a useful pedagogical tool. I recently started on a project which gave me access to Cursor and `Opus 4.5`, and I felt I needed a deep dive into their capabilities.

This repo was originally a fork of [karote00/local-leetcode-trainer](https://github.com/karote00/local-leetcode-trainer). I'm testing how well Cursor with `Opus 4.5` can convert it to Deno + TypeScript and implement various improvements to the CLI.

I'll update this README with the progress.
