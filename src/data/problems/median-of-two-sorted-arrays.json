  "difficulty": "hard",
  "description": "Given two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of size `m` and `n` respectively, return **the median** of the two sorted arrays.\n\nThe overall run time complexity should be `O(log (m+n))`.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "input": { "nums1": [1, 3], "nums2": [2] },
      "output": 2.0,
      "explanation": "merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2."
    },
    {
      "input": { "nums1": [1, 2], "nums2": [3, 4] },
      "output": 2.5,
      "explanation": "merged array = [1,2,3,4] and median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5."
    }
  ],
  "constraints": [
    "nums1.length == m",
    "nums2.length == n",
    "0 <= m <= 1000",
    "0 <= n <= 1000",
    "1 <= m + n <= 2000",
    "-10^6 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 10^6"
  ],
  "hints": [
    "Think about how you would partition both arrays such that elements on the left are all smaller than elements on the right.",
    "Binary search on the smaller array to find the correct partition point.",
    "The median can be found from the elements at the partition boundary."
