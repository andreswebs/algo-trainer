  "description": "Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "input": { "s": "abcabcbb" },
      "output": 3,
      "explanation": "The answer is \"abc\", with the length of 3."
    },

      "input": { "s": "bbbbb" },
      "output": 1,
      "explanation": "The answer is \"b\", with the length of 1."

    {
      "input": { "s": "pwwkew" },
      "output": 3,
      "explanation": "The answer is \"wke\", with the length of 3. Notice that the answer must be a substring, \"pwke\" is a subsequence and not a substring."

  "constraints": [
    "0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4",
    "s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces."

    "Use the sliding window technique with two pointers.",
    "A hash map or set can help you track characters in the current window.",
