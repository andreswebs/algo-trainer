  "description": "You are given an array of `k` linked-lists `lists`, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.\n\nMerge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "input": { "lists": [[1, 4, 5], [1, 3, 4], [2, 6]] },
      "output": [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6],
      "explanation": "The linked-lists are: [1->4->5, 1->3->4, 2->6]. Merging them into one sorted list: 1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6"

    "k == lists.length",
    "0 <= k <= 10^4",
    "0 <= lists[i].length <= 500",

    "lists[i] is sorted in ascending order.",
    "The sum of lists[i].length will not exceed 10^4."
  ],
  "hints": [
    "Consider using a min-heap (priority queue) to always get the smallest element across all lists.",
    "Another approach is divide and conquer: merge pairs of lists, then merge those results.",
    "You can reuse the 'merge two sorted lists' solution as a building block."
