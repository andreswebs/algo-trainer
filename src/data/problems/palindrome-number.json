  "description": "Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is a palindrome, and `false` otherwise.\n\nAn integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.\n\n- For example, `121` is a palindrome while `123` is not.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "input": { "x": 121 },
      "output": true,
      "explanation": "121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left."
    },
    {
      "input": { "x": -121 },
      "output": false,
      "explanation": "From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome."
    },
    {
      "input": { "x": 10 },
      "output": false,
      "explanation": "Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome."

    "Negative numbers are not palindromes. Think about why.",
