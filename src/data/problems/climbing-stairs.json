  "description": "You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.\n\nEach time you can either climb `1` or `2` steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?",
  "examples": [
    {
      "input": { "n": 2 },
      "output": 2,
      "explanation": "There are two ways to climb to the top: 1. 1 step + 1 step, 2. 2 steps"
    },

    "1 <= n <= 45"

  "hints": [
    "To reach step i, you can either come from step i-1 or step i-2. How does this help?",
    "This is essentially computing the Fibonacci sequence. Can you see why?",
    "You can optimize space by only keeping track of the last two values instead of the entire array."
