  "description": "You are given two **non-empty** linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in **reverse order**, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.\n\nYou may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "input": { "l1": [2, 4, 3], "l2": [5, 6, 4] },

  "hints": [
    "Traverse both lists simultaneously, adding corresponding digits.",
    "Don't forget to handle the carry when the sum is >= 10.",
    "What happens when the lists have different lengths? When there's a final carry?"
