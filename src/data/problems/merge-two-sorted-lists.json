  "description": "You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists `list1` and `list2`.\n\nMerge the two lists into one **sorted** list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.\n\nReturn the head of the merged linked list.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "input": { "list1": [1, 2, 4], "list2": [1, 3, 4] },
      "output": [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4]
    },

      "input": { "list1": [], "list2": [] },
      "output": []
    },
    {
      "input": { "list1": [], "list2": [0] },
      "output": [0]
    }
  ],
  "constraints": [
    "The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].",
    "-100 <= Node.val <= 100",
    "Both list1 and list2 are sorted in non-decreasing order."
  ],
  "hints": [
    "Use a dummy head node to simplify the merging process.",
    "Compare the current nodes of both lists and attach the smaller one to your result list.",
    "Don't forget to handle the case when one list is exhausted before the other."
