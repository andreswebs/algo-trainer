  "difficulty": "hard",
  "description": "Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is `1`, compute how much water it can trap after raining.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "input": { "height": [0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1] },
      "output": 6,
      "explanation": "The elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped."
    },
    {
      "input": { "height": [4, 2, 0, 3, 2, 5] },
      "output": 9
    }

  "constraints": [
    "n == height.length",
    "1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4",
    "0 <= height[i] <= 10^5"
  ],
  "hints": [
    "Water at any position is determined by the minimum of the maximum heights on both sides.",
    "You can precompute the maximum height to the left and right of each position.",
    "A two-pointer approach can solve this in O(1) space by processing from both ends."
