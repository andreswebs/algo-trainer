  "description": "You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `i`th line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.\n\nFind two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.\n\nReturn the maximum amount of water a container can store.\n\n**Notice** that you may not slant the container.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "input": { "height": [1, 8, 6, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7] },
      "output": 49,
      "explanation": "The vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water the container can contain is 49 (between index 1 and 8)."

  "constraints": [
    "n == height.length",
    "2 <= n <= 10^5",
    "0 <= height[i] <= 10^4"
  ],
  "hints": [
    "Start with the widest container (pointers at both ends) and work inward.",
    "The area is limited by the shorter line. Moving the shorter line inward might find a taller one.",
    "Moving the taller line inward can only decrease or maintain the area, never increase it."
