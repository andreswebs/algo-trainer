  "description": "Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).",
  "examples": [
    {
      "input": { "root": [3, 9, 20, null, null, 15, 7] },
      "output": [[3], [9, 20], [15, 7]]

    "The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2000].",

  "hints": [
    "Use a queue (BFS) to process nodes level by level.",
    "For each level, process all nodes currently in the queue before moving to the next level.",
    "Track the number of nodes at the current level to know when a level is complete."
